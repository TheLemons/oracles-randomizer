# subrosia has several large areas which are guaranteed to be traverseable as
# long as you can get there in the first place:
#
# 1. temple: rosa portal, dance hall, temple, smithy
# 2. beach: swamp portal, market, beach
# 3. hide and seek: H&S, mountain portal, spring tower
# 4. pirate house: village portal, pirates
# 5. bridge: bridge area (large but not visited in any%)
#
# furnace used to be on this list, but you can get there using an animal
# companion to jump over the holes at eyeglass lake, so you won't necessarily
# have feather.
